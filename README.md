- `requirements.txt`: Python package requirements.
- `thesis/`: final thesis document.

## Study Overview

The thesis investigates deterministic aircraft trajectory prediction in three-dimensional space using ADS-B state-vector data and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

The prediction task is formulated as **sequence-to-one regression**. A historical sequence of aircraft observations is used to predict the future displacement:

- latitude displacement,
- longitude displacement,
- altitude displacement.

The evaluated forecasting horizons are:

- **5 minutes** (`300 s`)
- **10 minutes** (`600 s`)
- **15 minutes** (`900 s`)

The final full-day robustness evaluation uses the selected `ENRICH_LSTM96` architecture for the **10-minute** and **15-minute** horizons.

## Data Source

The data used in the thesis were obtained from the **OpenSky Network** historical ADS-B database.

The raw ADS-B files are **not included in this repository** because of their size and data-access constraints.

To reproduce the experiments, corresponding OpenSky state-vector data must be obtained separately and exported as hourly CSV files.

### Spatial and Altitude Filtering

The thesis uses observations within the following study area:

- Latitude: **35° to 55° N**
- Longitude: **5° to 30° E**
- Barometric altitude: **above 6096 m (FL200)**

### Expected CSV Schema

Each hourly CSV file is expected to contain the following columns, in this order and without a header:

```text
icao24
callsign
time
lat
lon
baroaltitude
velocity
heading
vertrate
```

The code reads the files using:

- UTF-16 encoding,
- comma separator,
- no header row.

### Expected File Naming

The code assumes filenames of the form:

```text
opensky_FL200_YYYYMMDD_HH.csv
```

Examples:

```text
opensky_FL200_20190501_00.csv
opensky_FL200_20190501_01.csv
opensky_FL200_20190502_00.csv
...
opensky_FL200_20190502_23.csv
```

## Experimental Data Organization

The experimental workflow uses two stages.

### Development Stage

Initial baseline experiments, feature-enrichment experiments, and architecture comparison use the first hourly development file:

```text
opensky_FL200_20190501_00.csv
```

### Final Model Training

The final horizon-specific `ENRICH_LSTM96` models are retrained using the first two hourly development files:

```text
opensky_FL200_20190501_00.csv
opensky_FL200_20190501_01.csv
```

### Full-Day Evaluation

The final robustness and ETA-style temporal analyses use 24 consecutive hourly files labelled as May 2, 2019:

```text
opensky_FL200_20190502_00.csv
...
opensky_FL200_20190502_23.csv
```

The timestamps contained in these files should be interpreted separately from the filename labels, as described in the thesis.

## Preprocessing

The main preprocessing procedure includes:

1. Removal of observations with missing required variables.
2. Sorting observations by aircraft identifier (`icao24`) and timestamp.
3. Computation of time differences between consecutive observations.
4. Segmentation of trajectories whenever the temporal gap exceeds **60 seconds**.
5. Removal of trajectory segments shorter than **300 observations**.
6. Construction of first-order positional differences:
   - `dlat`
   - `dlon`
   - `dalt`
7. For the enriched representation:
   - ground velocity,
   - vertical rate,
   - sine of heading,
   - cosine of heading.
8. Clipping of:
   - velocity to `[0, 400] m/s`,
   - vertical rate to `[-50, 50] m/s`.

The input history length is:

```text
INPUT_LEN = 120
```

This represents **120 consecutive observations**, not a fixed number of elapsed seconds.

## Prediction Target Construction

Future targets are selected using **elapsed time**, not a fixed row offset.

For a current state at time `t` and forecasting horizon `H`, the code searches for the first observation at or after:

```text
t + H
```

A target is accepted only if the actual time gap differs from the requested horizon by no more than:

```text
10 seconds
```

The target is the future displacement relative to the current position:

```text
[Δlatitude, Δlongitude, Δaltitude]
```

## Dataset Sampling

To control computational cost and reduce over-representation of long trajectory segments:

```text
MAX_SAMPLES = 200000
per_traj_cap = 200
SEED = 42
```

The development datasets are randomly shuffled and partitioned into:

- **80% training**
- **10% validation**
- **10% test**

The split is performed at the window level.

## Input Representations

### Baseline Representation

The baseline model uses three features:

```text
dlat
dlon
dalt
```

### Enriched Representation

The enriched models use seven features:

```text
dlat
dlon
dalt
velocity
sin_hdg
cos_hdg
vertrate
```

## Model Architectures

Three enriched LSTM configurations are compared.

### ENRICH_LSTM64

```text
Input (120 × 7)
→ LSTM(64)
→ Dense(64, ReLU)
→ Dense(32, ReLU)
→ Dense(3, Linear)
```

### ENRICH_LSTM96

```text
Input (120 × 7)
→ LSTM(96)
→ Dense(64, ReLU)
→ Dense(32, ReLU)
→ Dense(3, Linear)
```

### ENRICH_LSTM64x32_DO20

```text
Input (120 × 7)
→ LSTM(64, return_sequences=True)
→ Dropout(0.20)
→ LSTM(32)
→ Dropout(0.20)
→ Dense(64, ReLU)
→ Dense(32, ReLU)
→ Dense(3, Linear)
```

`ENRICH_LSTM96` is selected as the common architecture for the final 10-minute and 15-minute evaluation.

## Training Configuration

The main training settings are:

```text
Optimizer: Adam
Learning rate: 1e-3
Loss: Mean Squared Error
Maximum epochs: 20
Batch size: 256
Early stopping patience: 3
Random seed: 42
```

Input features and target displacements are standardized using `StandardScaler`.

The scalers are fitted **only on the training subset** and then applied unchanged to validation and test data.

Predicted target values are inverse-transformed before physical-domain evaluation.

## Evaluation Metrics

### Horizontal Error

Horizontal prediction error is calculated using the Haversine great-circle distance and reported in kilometers.

The following summaries are used:

- Mean error
- Median error
- 90th percentile error (`p90`)

### Vertical Error

Vertical performance is measured using absolute barometric-altitude error in meters.

The following summaries are used:

- Mean altitude error
- Median altitude error

## Reproduction Instructions

The recommended environment is **Google Colab with Python 3**.

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

Either clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file.

### 2. Install Required Packages

In a Python environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Google Colab already includes several of these packages, but the command can be used to ensure the required dependencies are available.

### 3. Prepare Google Drive

The code is configured to use Google Drive.

Create the following directories:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/exports_hourly
/content/drive/MyDrive/opensky_models
/content/drive/MyDrive/opensky_results
```

Place the required hourly OpenSky CSV files in:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/exports_hourly
```

### 4. Verify File Names

At minimum, the development stage requires:

```text
opensky_FL200_20190501_00.csv
opensky_FL200_20190501_01.csv
```

The full-day evaluation additionally requires:

```text
opensky_FL200_20190502_00.csv
...
opensky_FL200_20190502_23.csv
```

### 5. Run the Notebook or Python Script

Two equivalent entry points are provided:

```text
code/opensky_thesis.ipynb
```

or

```text
code/opensky_thesis.py
```

For the notebook version, open it in Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially from top to bottom.

For the Python version, execute the script in a compatible environment with Google Drive mounted and the expected directory structure available.

### 6. Baseline Experiments

The pipeline first:

- loads the first development hourly file,
- preprocesses and segments the trajectories,
- constructs 3-feature baseline datasets,
- trains a 64-unit LSTM separately for the 5-, 10-, and 15-minute horizons,
- evaluates horizontal and vertical prediction errors.

### 7. Feature-Enrichment Experiments

The code then adds:

- ground velocity,
- vertical rate,
- sine and cosine heading representations,

and repeats the 5-, 10-, and 15-minute experiments using the enriched 7-feature input representation.

### 8. Architecture Comparison

The following models are compared for the 10-minute and 15-minute horizons:

```text
ENRICH_LSTM64
ENRICH_LSTM96
ENRICH_LSTM64x32_DO20
```

The architecture-comparison results are exported to:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/opensky_results/architecture_comparison_results.csv
```

### 9. Final ENRICH_LSTM96 Training

The final 10-minute and 15-minute `ENRICH_LSTM96` models are retrained using the first two development hourly files.

The trained models and fitted scalers are stored in:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/opensky_models
```

Expected files include:

```text
ENRICH_LSTM96_10min.keras
ENRICH_LSTM96_10min_x_scaler.pkl
ENRICH_LSTM96_10min_y_scaler.pkl

ENRICH_LSTM96_15min.keras
ENRICH_LSTM96_15min_x_scaler.pkl
ENRICH_LSTM96_15min_y_scaler.pkl
```

### 10. Full-Day Robustness Evaluation

The final models are applied independently to the 24 hourly evaluation files.

The resulting hourly spatial metrics are saved to:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/opensky_results/full_day_20190502_ENRICH_LSTM96.csv
```

The reported full-day summary is obtained by aggregating the independently calculated hourly metrics.

In particular, the reported full-day `p90` is the **mean of the hourly p90 values**, not a single percentile calculated after pooling all full-day prediction errors.

## Derived ETA-Style Temporal Metric

The thesis also evaluates a derived fixed-horizon temporal proxy.

For each prediction sample:

- `d_true` is the realized horizontal displacement from the current position to the true future position.
- `d_pred` is the predicted horizontal displacement from the current position to the predicted future position.
- `H` is the forecasting horizon in seconds.

The derived temporal estimate is computed as:

```text
eta_hat = H × (d_true / d_pred)
```

and the temporal error is:

```text
eta_error = eta_hat - H
```

For numerical stability:

```text
d_pred >= 1e-3 km
```

and temporal errors are clipped to:

```text
±3600 seconds
```

This metric is **not a conventional destination-specific Estimated Time of Arrival prediction**. It is used only as a horizon-based temporal interpretation of the spatial trajectory-prediction results.

The hourly ETA-style results are saved to:

```text
/content/drive/MyDrive/opensky_results/full_day_20190502_ENRICH_LSTM96_with_ETA.csv
```

## Horizon-Normalized Analysis

The final stage computes:

```text
horizontal error / prediction-horizon duration
```

and

```text
ETA-style absolute error / prediction-horizon duration
```

for the 10-minute and 15-minute full-day results.

These values are used only to describe the scaling behavior observed across the two evaluated horizons.

## Expected Main Output Files

After a complete run, the principal generated files are:

```text
opensky_results/
├── architecture_comparison_results.csv
├── full_day_20190502_ENRICH_LSTM96.csv
└── full_day_20190502_ENRICH_LSTM96_with_ETA.csv

opensky_models/
├── ENRICH_LSTM96_10min.keras
├── ENRICH_LSTM96_10min_x_scaler.pkl
├── ENRICH_LSTM96_10min_y_scaler.pkl
├── ENRICH_LSTM96_15min.keras
├── ENRICH_LSTM96_15min_x_scaler.pkl
└── ENRICH_LSTM96_15min_y_scaler.pkl
```

Plots used to inspect baseline performance, feature enrichment, architecture comparison, hourly robustness, ETA-style errors, and horizon-normalized error behavior are generated during execution.

## Reproducibility Notes and Limitations

Several points should be considered when reproducing the experiments:

- The raw OpenSky dataset is not distributed with this repository.
- Access to the same historical OpenSky data is required for exact replication.
- The development split is a random **window-level** 80/10/10 split.
- Overlapping windows may therefore occur across development subsets.
- The historical input contains **120 observations**, not a fixed 120-second interval.
- Future targets are selected using timestamp-based elapsed-time matching.
- Separate models and scalers are used for each forecasting horizon.
- The final full-day evaluation is temporally distinct from the development files but remains within the same general geographical and temporal study setting.
- TensorFlow training can show small numerical differences across hardware, software versions, and runtime environments even when the same random seed is used.
- Exact package versions from the original Google Colab runtime were not permanently recorded; `requirements.txt` therefore lists the required packages without asserting unverified historical version numbers.

## Software Requirements

The project uses:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- joblib
- Google Colab / Google Drive integration
